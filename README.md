# Genshin Impact Code Scraper
- This script gathers the codes from a variety of sources and compiles a list.
- This script runs daily and should not have duplicate codes.
- After a week valid code(s) will be moved to a list of invalid ("archived") codes.
- There is a list of potentially valid codes (within codes.json) that have been "thrown out" into the "invalid" bucket as I know my filters are a bit presumptive.

## Inspiration
- https://github.com/Scoofszlo/genshinimpact_codetracker
- My main goal was to automate this task.

## For Bug Fixes and Improvements
- Feel free to either reach out or submit a PR.
